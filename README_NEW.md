## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Configuring Miner ID and Identity Wallet

Heurist Miner uses a dual-wallet system for security and reward distribution:

1. **Identity Wallet**: Used for authentication, stored locally. Do not store funds here.
2. **Reward Wallet (Miner ID)**: Receives points and potential rewards.

#### Setting Up Your Wallets

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your miner installation.
2. Add your Ethereum wallet address(es) as Miner ID(s):
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere
   MINER_ID_1=0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere
   ```
3. (Optional) Add custom tags for tracking:
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xYourFirstWalletAddressHere-GamingPC4090
   MINER_ID_1=0xYourSecondWalletAddressHere-GoogleCloudT4
   ```
4. Generate or import identity wallets:
   ```bash
   python3 ./auth/generator.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create new wallets or import existing ones.

## Large Language Model Miner Setup

### Setup Process

1. **Ensure CUDA Driver is Installed**:
   - Check with `nvidia-smi`
2. **Select a Model ID**:
   - Choose based on your GPU's VRAM capacity
   - Example models:
     - `openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b-gptq` (10GB VRAM)
     - `mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1` (28GB VRAM)
3. **Run the Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x llm-miner-starter.sh
   ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --miner-id-index 0 --port 8000 --gpu-ids 0
   ```
   Options:
- `--miner-id-index`: Index of miner_id in `.env` (default: 0)
- `--port`: Port for vLLM process (default: 8000)
- `--gpu-ids`: GPU ID to use (default: 0)
4. **Wait for Model Download**:
- First run will download the model (can take time)
- Models are saved in `$HOME/.cache/huggingface`

Note: 8x7b, 34b, and 70b models may take up to an hour to load on some devices.


## Advanced Configuration for Heurist Miners

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Options

#### Stable Diffusion Miner

When running the SD miner, you can use various CLI options to customize its behavior:

1. **Log Level**
   - Set the verbosity of log messages:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner-v1.3.1.py --log-level DEBUG
     ```
   - Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL (default: INFO)

2. **Auto-Confirm**
   - Automatically confirm model downloads:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner-v1.3.1.py --auto-confirm yes
     ```
   - Options: yes, no (default: no)

3. **Exclude SDXL**
   - Exclude SDXL models to reduce VRAM usage:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner-v1.3.1.py --exclude-sdxl
     ```

4. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner-v1.3.1.py --model-id <model_id>
     ```

5. **CUDA Device ID**
   - Specify which GPU to use:
     ```bash
     python3 sd-miner-v1.3.1.py --cuda-device-id 0
     ```

#### Large Language Model Miner

For LLM miner, use the following CLI options to customize its behavior:

1. **Specify Model ID**
   - Run the miner with a specific model (mandatory):
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id>
     ```
   - Example: `openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b-gptq` (requires 12GB VRAM)

2. **Miner ID Index**
   - Specify which miner ID from the `.env` file to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --miner-id-index 1
     ```
   - Default: 0 (uses the first address configured)

3. **Port**
   - Set the port for communication with the vLLM process:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --port 8001
     ```
   - Default: 8000

4. **GPU IDs**
   - Specify which GPU(s) to use:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh <model_id> --gpu-ids 1
     ```
   - Default: 0

   - Example combining multiple options:
     ```bash
     ./llm-miner-starter.sh openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b-gptq --miner-id-index 1 --port 8001 --gpu-ids 1
     ```

### Multiple GPU Configuration

To utilize multiple GPUs:

1. Assign unique Miner IDs in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MINER_ID_0=0xWalletAddress1
   MINER_ID_1=0xWalletAddress2
   ```
2. Set `num_cuda_devices` in `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [system]
   num_cuda_devices = 2
   ```
3. Run the miner without specifying a CUDA device ID to use all available GPUs.
